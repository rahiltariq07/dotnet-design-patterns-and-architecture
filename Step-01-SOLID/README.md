## Step 1 – SOLID Principles

### S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- One class should have one responsibility
- Responsibility = reason to change

### O – Open / Closed Principle (OCP)
- Open for extension
- Closed for modification
- Use interfaces and polymorphism

### L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Child class must fully replace parent class
- No unexpected behavior

### I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Do not force classes to implement unused methods
- Prefer small, focused interfaces

### D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes
- Foundation of Dependency Injection

### Key Takeaway
SOLID principles help create flexible, testable, and maintainable code.
