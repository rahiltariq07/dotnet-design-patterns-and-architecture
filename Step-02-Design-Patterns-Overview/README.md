## Step 2 – Design Patterns Overview

### What Is a Design Pattern?
- A reusable solution to common software design problems
- Not code, not a library, not a framework

### Why Design Patterns Exist
- Software constantly changes
- Patterns make code flexible and maintainable

### What Design Patterns Are NOT
- Not mandatory
- Not always needed
- Not a sign of good code by default

### Categories of Design Patterns
1. Creational – Object creation
2. Structural – Object structure
3. Behavioral – Object communication

### Important Rule
Use design patterns only when they solve a real problem.
Avoid over-engineering.
