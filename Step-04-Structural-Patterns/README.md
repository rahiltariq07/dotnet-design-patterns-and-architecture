## Step 4 – Structural Design Patterns

### What Structural Patterns Solve
- How classes and objects are connected
- How to extend behavior without modifying code

### Patterns Covered

#### Adapter
- Converts one interface to another
- Useful for legacy or third-party code

#### Decorator
- Adds behavior dynamically
- Used heavily in ASP.NET Core middleware

#### Facade
- Simplifies complex systems
- Provides a clean interface

#### Proxy
- Controls access to an object
- Used for security, caching, lazy loading

#### Composite
- Treats individual and group objects uniformly

### Key Takeaway
Structural patterns help organize and extend existing code safely.
